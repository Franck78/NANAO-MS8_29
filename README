This is a reverse engineering schematic from a NANAO MS8-29

There is a lot of similarities with MS8-28 wich have some schematics available.


  
I used partlist for the MS8-29FSG found in the Daytona-1 manual.




This schematic needs some review, some rechecks etc etc etc.

It uses KiCad 5.1
Describe me fixes or send PR for KiCad 5.1


BODGES

A capacitor is piggy backed on resistor R566. I naned this cap C566, it is a 4Âµ7/100v


A 330R resistor is added on R564 wich makes no sense. Probably specific to my board.

The heater resistance R571 (4R7) have a paralell resistor 0R56
